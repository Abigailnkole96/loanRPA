#result.html: Displays the outcome of the loan application process, i.e., whether the loan is approved or rejected.
#Why: HTML pages allow users to interact with the application by submitting loan data and viewing results.
#The form takes user input for salary, credit score, and loan amount, and the result page displays whether the loan is approved or rejected.
